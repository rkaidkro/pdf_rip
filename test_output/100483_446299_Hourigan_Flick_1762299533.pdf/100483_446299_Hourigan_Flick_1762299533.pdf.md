**Dear Hiring Panel,**

I am writing to express my interest in the Support Officer position within the Data Management and Applications (DMA) team at CSIRO. Having worked across various IMT roles at CSIRO — including IMT Operations Support, Software Administration, and Travel Services — I bring a strong track record in platform support, stakeholder engagement, and cross-team collaboration. I am passionate about technology-enabled service delivery and committed to supporting CSIRO’s research through operational excellence and continuous improvement.

## Selection Criteria Responses — Essential

1. **A relevant certificate, diploma, or degree in IT, Computer Science, or equivalent experience.**  
   I hold extensive relevant experience across technical support roles at CSIRO, including software and hardware administration. My work with platforms such as SAP, HP Records, Compass, SharePoint, and Outlook demonstrates practical IT knowledge. I have also undertaken formal training in Excel, Outlook, and emerging software technologies.

2. **Experience in operational support roles, assisting users and resolving platform/service issues.**  
   In my current role managing overseas travel logistics, I regularly troubleshoot platform-based issues (e.g., Telstraroam, Compass approvals, and SAP workflows). I coordinate closely with users to resolve concerns, ensure compliance, and liaise with service providers to deliver effective support.

3. **Experience supporting administration or configuration of enterprise platforms.**  
   I have administered and supported enterprise systems like SAP (procurements, contracts, and tracking), HP Records (document control), and Compass (workflows, travel requester). I understand provisioning dates, access controls, and workflow configurations at the user-support level.

4. **Strong verbal and written communication skills for business and technical purposes.**  
   Throughout my roles in IMT and the Future Services Group, I have liaised with a wide range of stakeholders—from CSIRO executives to Telstra and DHB representatives. I tailor my communications to the audience, providing clearer, perceptual insights, and results-oriented interactions.

5. **Awareness of data privacy, security, and governance principles.**  
   I routinely handle sensitive data and ensure compliance with CSIRO policies. For example, when staff travel to high-risk countries with CSIRO devices, I assess compliance and escalate to Cyber Security when appropriate. I understand the importance of securing CSIRO data and following governance procedures.

6. **Attention to detail, ownership, and commitment to resolution.**  
   Whether tracking contract procurements in SAP, maintaining meeting minutes, or managing international travel issues; I consistently apply attention to detail. I follow through on tasks independently, escalating and resolving issues while documenting outcomes precisely.

7. **Organisational and analytical skills with a structured problem-solving approach.**  
   Managing high volumes of travel requests and incident escalations requires strong organisational systems. I use Excel and Outlook to prioritise, track, and resolve requests, applying structured workflows to ensure accuracy and service continuity.

8. **Ability to manage multiple tasks and adapt to dynamic environments.**  
   I manage concurrent service requests from CSIRO teams and external vendors and adapt quickly to changing priorities. I use task systems (e.g., Jira, Outlook, SharePoint) to maintain visibility over workloads and ensure delivery under pressure.

9. **Customer service mindset and ability to support users.**  
   I approach every task with a focus on the end user—whether it’s guiding staff through software workflows, responding to approval issues, or advising on travel risks. My approachable, empathetic style consistently supports positive experiences.

10. **Willingness to take initiative and seek solutions.**  
    I proactively developed improved workflows for managing overseas travel approvals and streamlined internal processes. I also provide guidance to teams on navigating platforms, ensuring clarity and resolution even when initial information is ambiguous.

### 11. Collaborative team approach and ability to build relationships.

I've worked across regionally dispersed CSIRO teams and supported roles in HR, finance, and operations. I actively foster productive working relationships and regularly assist team members with shared tools and resources, reflecting my collaborative mindset.

While I haven’t directly supported platforms such as Talent Marketplace (Reeig), Risk Management (eClics), Electronically sign documents (DocuSign) or Health, Safety, Environment, Risk, and Supplier (Domisite); I have hands-on experience in enterprise systems and am confident in my ability to quickly become a functional expert. I understand platform provisioning, knowledge base development, and user support processes. I also have exposure to Jira and SharePoint and am keen to deepen my knowledge in Azure, SaaS, automation tools (e.g., Power Platform), and SQL databases principles through the professional development opportunities offered.

With over a decade of internal CSIRO experience, I bring a deep understanding of organizational priorities, user needs, and enterprise systems. I'm passionate about enabling teams through smart technology and user-focused support. My strengths in coordination, documentation, and client service would make me a valuable contributor to the DMA team's operational and service delivery goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be grateful of the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to the continued success of CSIRO's Data Management and Applications team.

Yours sincerely,  
Felicity Hourigan

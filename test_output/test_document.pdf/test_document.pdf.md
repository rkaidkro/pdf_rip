Sample Document
This is a sample document created for testing the PDF Rip pipeline.
Introduction
This document contains various types of content to test the PDF processing capabilities:
• Text content with different formatting
• Lists and bullet points
• Tables with structured data
• Mathematical equations (simulated)
• Contact information for PII testing
The goal is to verify that the PDF Rip pipeline can accurately extract and convert all these elements to

Mathematical Content
Sample equation: E = mc²
Another equation: 
∫
 f(x) dx = F(x) + C
Summation: 
Σ
(i=1 to n) i = n(n+1)/2

Code Examples
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "test"
    
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
Conclusion
This document demonstrates various content types that the PDF Rip pipeline should be able to proces
1. Structured text with headings
2. Lists and bullet points
3. Tables with data
4. Mathematical notation
5. Code blocks
6. Contact information (for PII testing)
The pipeline should convert all of this content to clean, well-formatted Markdown while preserving the s
